NAME
    MongoDBx::Queue - A message queue implemented with MongoDB

VERSION
    version 1.002

SYNOPSIS
        use v5.10;
        use MongoDBx::Queue;

        my $queue = MongoDBx::Queue->new(
            database_name => "queue_db",
            client_options => {
                host => "mongodb://example.net:27017",
                username => "willywonka",
                password => "ilovechocolate",
            }
        );

        $queue->add_task( { msg => "Hello World" } );
        $queue->add_task( { msg => "Goodbye World" } );

        while ( my $task = $queue->reserve_task ) {
            say $task->{msg};
            $queue->remove_task( $task );
        }

DESCRIPTION
    MongoDBx::Queue implements a simple, prioritized message queue using
    MongoDB as a backend. By default, messages are prioritized by insertion
    time, creating a FIFO queue.

    On a single host with MongoDB, it provides a zero-configuration message
    service across local applications. Alternatively, it can use a MongoDB
    database cluster that provides replication and fail-over for an even
    more durable, multi-host message queue.

    Features:

    *   messages as hash references, not objects

    *   arbitrary message fields

    *   arbitrary scheduling on insertion

    *   atomic message reservation

    *   stalled reservations can be timed-out

    *   task rescheduling

    *   automatically creates correct index

    *   fork-safe

    Not yet implemented:

    *   parameter checking

    *   error handling

    Warning: do not use with capped collections, as the queued messages will
    not meet the constraints required by a capped collection.

ATTRIBUTES
  database_name
    A MongoDB database name. Unless a "db_name" is provided in the
    "client_options" attribute, this database will be the default for
    authentication. Defaults to 'test'

  client_options
    A hash reference of MongoDB::MongoClient options that will be passed to
    its "connect" method.

  collection_name
    A collection name for the queue. Defaults to 'queue'. The collection
    must only be used by MongoDBx::Queue or unpredictable awful things will
    happen.

  safe
    Boolean that controls whether 'safe' inserts/updates are done. Defaults
    to true.

METHODS
  new
       $queue = MongoDBx::Queue->new(
            database_name   => "my_app",
            client_options  => {
                host => "mongodb://example.net:27017",
                username => "willywonka",
                password => "ilovechocolate",
            },
       );

    Creates and returns a new queue object.

  add_task
      $queue->add_task( \%message, \%options );

    Adds a task to the queue. The "\%message" hash reference will be shallow
    copied into the task and not include objects except as described by
    MongoDB::DataTypes. Top-level keys must not start with underscores,
    which are reserved for MongoDBx::Queue.

    The "\%options" hash reference is optional and may contain the following
    key:

    *   "priority": sets the priority for the task. Defaults to "time()".

    Note that setting a "future" priority may cause a task to be invisible
    to "reserve_task". See that method for more details.

  reserve_task
      $task = $queue->reserve_task;
      $task = $queue->reserve_task( \%options );

    Atomically marks and returns a task. The task is marked in the queue as
    "reserved" (in-progress) so it can not be reserved again unless is is
    rescheduled or timed-out. The task returned is a hash reference
    containing the data added in "add_task", including private keys for use
    by MongoDBx::Queue methods.

    Tasks are returned in priority order from lowest to highest. If multiple
    tasks have identical, lowest priorities, their ordering is undefined. If
    no tasks are available or visible, it will return "undef".

    The "\%options" hash reference is optional and may contain the following
    key:

    *   "max_priority": sets the maximum priority for the task. Defaults to
        "time()".

    The "max_priority" option controls whether "future" tasks are visible.
    If the lowest task priority is greater than the "max_priority", this
    method returns "undef".

  reschedule_task
      $queue->reschedule_task( $task );
      $queue->reschedule_task( $task, \%options );

    Releases the reservation on a task so it can be reserved again.

    The "\%options" hash reference is optional and may contain the following
    key:

    *   "priority": sets the priority for the task. Defaults to the task's
        original priority.

    Note that setting a "future" priority may cause a task to be invisible
    to "reserve_task". See that method for more details.

  remove_task
      $queue->remove_task( $task );

    Removes a task from the queue (i.e. indicating the task has been
    processed).

  apply_timeout
      $queue->apply_timeout( $seconds );

    Removes reservations that occurred more than $seconds ago. If no
    argument is given, the timeout defaults to 120 seconds. The timeout
    should be set longer than the expected task processing time, so that
    only dead/hung tasks are returned to the active queue.

  search
      my @results = $queue->search( \%query, \%options );

    Returns a list of tasks in the queue based on search criteria. The query
    should be expressed in the usual MongoDB fashion. In addition to MongoDB
    options "limit", "skip" and "sort", this method supports a "reserved"
    option. If present, results will be limited to reserved tasks if true or
    unreserved tasks if false.

  peek
      $task = $queue->peek( $task );

    Retrieves a full copy of the task from the queue. This is useful to
    retrieve all fields from a partial-field result from "search". It is
    equivalent to:

      $self->search( { _id => $task->{_id} } );

    Returns undef if the task is not found.

  size
      $queue->size;

    Returns the number of tasks in the queue, including in-progress ones.

  waiting
      $queue->waiting;

    Returns the number of tasks in the queue that have not been reserved.
